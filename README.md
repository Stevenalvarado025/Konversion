**YouTube to MP3 converter for the terminal.** Paste a link, get an MP3. That's it.

Built for producers and artists who just want to rip audio from YouTube without dealing with sketchy websites or bloated apps.

---

## What It Does

- Paste any YouTube URL and it downloads + converts to high quality MP3 (320kbps)
- Shows you the track title, channel, and duration before downloading
- Progress bar so you can see the download happening
- Automatically embeds metadata (title, artist, thumbnail) into the MP3
- MP3s are saved to your Downloads folder
- Shows you the exact file path and size when it's done

---

## Quick Install (macOS / Linux)

Open **Terminal** and paste this single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stvn444/Konversion/main/install.sh | bash
```

This automatically downloads and installs Konversion for your system.

**You still need yt-dlp and ffmpeg.** The installer will tell you if they're missing. Install them:

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

> Don't have Homebrew? Install it first: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

Then just type `konversion` to run it.

---

## Install (Windows)

1. Download `konversion-windows-amd64.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Stvn444/Konversion/releases)
2. Rename it to `konversion.exe` and put it somewhere in your PATH
3. Install [ffmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) — download "ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip", extract it, and add the `bin` folder to your PATH
4. Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) — download `yt-dlp.exe` and put it in a folder that's in your PATH

Then open Command Prompt or PowerShell and type:

```bash
konversion
```

---

## How to Use

Just type `konversion` in Terminal (all lowercase):

```bash
konversion
```

You'll see the Konversion banner and a prompt. Paste your YouTube URL and press Enter:

```
Enter YouTube URL (or 'quit' to exit): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

  Title:    Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up
  Channel:  Rick Astley
  Duration: 3:33

  Downloading and converting to MP3 (320 kbps)...
  ██████████████████████████████ 100.0%
Saved: /Users/you/Downloads/Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up.mp3 (8.2 MB)

Enter YouTube URL (or 'quit' to exit):
```

It loops — keep pasting URLs back to back. Type `quit` when you're done.

### Where Do My MP3s Go?

Your **Downloads** folder. After every download it prints the full path so you know exactly where to find it.

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: konversion"

Re-run the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stvn444/Konversion/main/install.sh | bash
```

Make sure you're typing it **all lowercase**: `konversion` (not `Konversion`).

### "yt-dlp is not installed"

```bash
brew install yt-dlp         # macOS
pip install yt-dlp           # any system with Python
sudo apt install yt-dlp      # Ubuntu/Debian
```

### "ffmpeg is not installed"

```bash
brew install ffmpeg          # macOS
sudo apt install ffmpeg      # Ubuntu/Debian
```

### "Invalid YouTube URL format"

Make sure you're pasting the full URL. These formats work:

- `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
- `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`
- `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`

### How do I update Konversion?

Just run the install script again:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stvn444/Konversion/main/install.sh | bash
```

## How It Works

Konversion is a Go wrapper around two industry-standard open source tools:

- **[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)** — downloads video/audio from YouTube
- **[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** — converts audio to MP3 format

Konversion handles the terminal UI, progress bar, metadata display, and makes the whole process as simple as paste-and-go. No Python scripts, no browser extensions, no sketchy websites with popups.
